//! Vendor-neutral helpers every MCP tool handler in this family needs.
//!
//! Three concerns, deliberately kept apart:
//!
//! - **Rendering a result** — [`tool_result`], [`tool_error`], [`bounded_text`].
//!   A handler's return value is caller-visible and vendor-sized, so it is
//!   bounded before it leaves. [`tool_result`] also redacts it —
//!   see [`OutputRedaction`].
//! - **Authorizing a call** — [`authorize_call`] and the rest of
//!   [`mod@authorize`]. Note the rule stated there: a `None` caller is the
//!   stdio path and is authorized, so a handler must pass the caller it
//!   recovered rather than `None` on a lookup miss.
//! - **Shaping a device response** — [`xml_to_json`] turns device XML into a
//!   [`serde_json::Value`] tree instead of a string a model has to re-parse
//!   out of its own escaping. It runs after redaction, not instead of it —
//!   see its module docs.
//!
//! Nothing here knows a vendor's names, paths, headers, models, or statuses.
//! That is the whole point: three servers were carrying their own copy of this
//! logic, and a copy is a place for two of them to disagree about what a limit
//! or a scope means.
//!
//! ## Limits are refusals, not truncation
//!
//! [`tool_result`] returns an MCP **error** when a successful value exceeds its
//! limits; it does not send a shortened value. A caller handed a silently
//! truncated result cannot tell it from a complete one, and a handler's job is
//! to be trustworthy about what it returns rather than to always return
//! something.
//!
//! [`bounded_text`] is the other half, for the places that genuinely want a
//! prefix — a log line, a preview — and it says so in its return value.
//! [`truncate_items`] is the list-shaped version of the same idea, for a
//! handler that would rather hand back the first `N` of `M` entries with an
//! explicit marker than refuse the whole call.
//!
//! ## Redaction runs inside `tool_result`, not beside it
//!
//! [`tool_result`] passes every successful value through `mecmcp-redact`
//! before it is measured against [`ResultLimits`] or handed back to the
//! caller. Earlier, redaction was something a server had to remember to call
//! on its own output path; a new tool handler that built its result with
//! `tool_result` and forgot to redact it first still leaked whatever it
//! returned. Routing redaction through `tool_result` itself removes that
//! failure mode — there is no successful [`rmcp::model::CallToolResult`]
//! `tool_result` can produce without it, short of the one exception below.
//!
//! The exception is [`OutputRedaction::SkipForInternalRead`], for a handler
//! whose result never touched a vendor device or controller — reading this
//! process's own audit log or policy snapshot, say — where running the
//! device-secret denylist over the process's own data is pure noise. Choosing
//! it is an explicit, per-call decision (there is no process-wide flag for
//! it, unlike `mecmcp_redact::policy`) and it is audited: it emits a
//! `target: "audit"` event naming the tool and the reason, every time.
