//! Junos profile (MEC-1245): two pieces of redaction coverage rustjunosmcp's
//! `collect_jtac_support_bundle` (`redact=true`, the default) needs that this
//! crate's vendor-agnostic `crate::xml`/`crate::text` passes do not provide
//! on their own.
//!
//! - [`redact_xml`] — the generic XML pass (denylisted element/attribute
//!   names plus the [`crate::shape`] value-shape catch-all) already covers
//!   most of rustjunosmcp's locked `REDACT_ELEMENT_NAMES` list. What is left
//!   over is a handful of element names (e.g. a bare `<value>` element, as in
//!   the NTP `authentication-key` secret,
//!   `<key><name>1</name><type>md5</type><value>$9$...</value></key>`) that
//!   are deliberately not on [`crate::denylist`] — as a substring or exact
//!   match they are far too generic to redact unconditionally across every
//!   vendor this crate serves — but within Junos's own closed NETCONF element
//!   vocabulary, treating them as unconditionally secret-bearing is the same
//!   judgement call rustjunosmcp already made and has shipped on for years.
//!   [`is_extra_secret_element`] derives this set from
//!   [`redact_log_text`]'s own `REDACT_LOG_KEYS` vocabulary rather than
//!   hand-maintaining a second list, so the XML and text passes cannot drift
//!   apart on which Junos-specific names are secret-bearing. [`redact_xml`]
//!   is the generic pass plus that derived set, not a second XML scanner
//!   (parser differentials are exactly the risk a second hand-rolled XML walk
//!   would invite).
//! - [`redact_log_text`] — a conservative, `set`-statement-aware line
//!   redactor for the non-XML support-bundle artefacts (`/var/log/*` files,
//!   `request support information` tech-support output). This is *not* a
//!   thin wrapper over `crate::text::redact`: that pass is substring-keyed
//!   and intentionally over-redacts (documented, accepted cost for the
//!   generic multi-vendor case) — it matches `secret` inside `secretary` and
//!   flags a bare prose mention of a denylisted word with no config-syntax
//!   signal at all. A support bundle's `/var/log/*` files are full of prose
//!   (syslog messages, command echoes), so that cost is not acceptable here.
//!   This pass instead whole-word-matches a closed, Junos-specific key list
//!   and only redacts the following value when a config-syntax signal is
//!   present: quotes, a `=`, a trailing `;`/`{`, a Junos crypt hash, or a
//!   preceding `set` statement (including one echoed mid-line in a
//!   `UI_CMDLINE_READ_LINE` syslog entry).
//!
//! Ported from `rust-junosmcp-srx-core/src/workflows/support_bundle/redact.rs`
//! (Phase 3 design doc § "Redact rules"; `docs/superpowers/plans/`
//! `2026-07-13-audit-field-redaction.md`), which becomes a thin call-through
//! to this module.
