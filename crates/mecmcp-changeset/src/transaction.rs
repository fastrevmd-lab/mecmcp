//! Device transaction trait and associated types.
//!
//! The [`DeviceTransaction`] trait abstracts vendor-specific configuration
//! transactions behind a common lifecycle: fingerprint → stage → diff →
//! validate → commit. Both PAN-OS (XPath set/delete + detached commit workers)
//! and Junos (NETCONF candidate/commit with synchronous operations and
//! confirmed-commit auto-rollback) implement this trait without adapters.

/// Fingerprint-bound change transaction on a vendor device.
///
/// Implementations must guarantee:
///
/// - **Fingerprint stability:** Two consecutive [`fingerprint()`](Self::fingerprint)
///   calls with no intervening mutation return the same value. Background changes
///   by another session invalidate a staged operation's fingerprint binding; the
///   coordinator detects this during [`diff()`](Self::diff) or
///   [`validate()`](Self::validate) and fails the operation.
///
/// - **Stage atomicity:** [`stage()`](Self::stage) applies all actions or none.
///   A partial failure (e.g., second action fails) must revert the first action
///   before returning an error. The returned `Staged` handle represents a
///   consistent snapshot. This holds for every implementation, including one
///   reporting [`Atomicity::atomic_apply`] `= false` -- the coordinator's apply
///   path depends on it. See [`stage()`](Self::stage) for why that declaration
///   does not yet relax this.
///
/// - **Indeterminate honesty:** [`commit()`](Self::commit) returns
///   [`CommitOutcome::Indeterminate`] on timeout or cancellation rather than
///   guessing the remote state. The caller persists recovery instructions and
///   exposes manual reconciliation. An implementation must never silently resolve
///   an unknown outcome as success or failure.
///
/// - **Fingerprint scope:** What the fingerprint covers is vendor-specific.
///   PAN-OS fingerprints the operator-authorized candidate subtrees listed in
///   inventory policy. Junos fingerprints the entire candidate configuration
///   database. A vendor with no candidate database fingerprints the running
///   state of the resources it will touch. All are stable (same input → same
///   hash) and binding (any change to the in-scope content changes the hash).
///   An implementation documents its scope and guarantees the hash detects all
///   mutations within that scope.
