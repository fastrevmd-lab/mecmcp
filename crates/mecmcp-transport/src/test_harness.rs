//! Serve a [`ServePlan`] on loopback for integration tests.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! [`ServePlan`] deliberately offers no way to extract its `Router`
//! (mecmcp#273): if the router could leave the plan, a consumer could serve it
//! directly and skip the listener admission checks, which is the defect that
//! design closes.
//!
//! That opacity has a cost this crate has to pay for, not push downstream. When
//! 0.9.0 landed, four consumer repositories had integration tests that drove the
//! router through `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`. With the router sealed, two
//! deleted those tests, one disabled four files and relaxed `unsafe_code` from
//! `forbid` to `warn`, and one wrote an `unsafe` helper that assumed the
//! struct's field layout and segfaulted. Every one of those is worse than the
//! problem it solved.
//!
//! The supported answer is to serve the plan for real and talk to it over HTTP —
//! which also tests more than `oneshot` did, since it exercises the bind path
//! and the listener refusals. This module makes that a one-liner so nobody has
//! to reinvent it, or route around it.
//!
//! Test-only. Never reachable from a release build.
