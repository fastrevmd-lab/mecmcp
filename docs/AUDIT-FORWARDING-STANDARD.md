# Audit forwarding standard

**Status:** emission rules are **normative now**. Transport is **implemented**
— the direct hash-chained ClickHouse (SSDF) sink described in Part 2 first
shipped in mecmcp **0.14.0** (2026-08-23; see
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md)) — see
[#292](https://github.com/mechubsec/mecmcp/issues/292) for the
implementation history. It carries the change-lifecycle evidence records
(proposal, approval, apply intent, receipt); the per-call tool audit stream
(Part 1's `audit.jsonl`) is not forwarded and stays on the host. SSDF is the
chain of record for those records; an optional, additive
[forward sink](#a-second-destination-the-generic-forward-sink) (MEC-459) can
ship the same chained records to a second off-host destination alongside it.
Syslog forwarding was designed, staged and rejected — see
[Why not syslog](#why-not-syslog-to-the-existing-collector) below. See
[Enabling it](#enabling-it) to turn it on for a server.

## Why this exists

An audit record that only exists on the machine that produced it is not an audit
trail. It is a log file on a box whose operator is the party the record is about.

The family already emits good records — server-verified `actor_type`, `provider`
and `on_behalf_of`, kept deliberately distinct from client-asserted fields via
`token_verified_fields`. The gap is transport: those records terminate on the MCP
host.

## Part 1 — Emission (normative)

Every server, regardless of how the records are later shipped:

1. **`--audit-format json`.** Always. The `text` format is for reading in a
   terminal; it is not a parse target and must never be forwarded. Five of the
   fifteen deployed servers were emitting `text`.
2. **`--audit-log-file <state-dir>/audit.jsonl`.** journald-only is not
   sufficient — the file is the operator-facing artifact and the natural spool
   source. Eleven of fifteen were journald-only.
3. **Rotate it.** The file grows without bound; the server never truncates it.

These rules are transport-independent and hold under any of the options below.

## Part 2 — Transport

**Decision: direct ClickHouse sink, hash-chained.** SSDF is the schema steward;
the contract is theirs:

- [`audit-evidence-contract-v1.md`](https://github.com/mechubsec/ssdf/blob/main/docs/audit-evidence-contract-v1.md)
- [`audit-evidence-ingestion.md`](https://github.com/mechubsec/ssdf/blob/main/docs/audit-evidence-ingestion.md)

Records are written by `mecmcp-audit` directly into `ssdf.audit` over the
ClickHouse HTTP interface, carrying `prev_hash`/`row_hash` so that deletion or
modification of a row is detectable.

Implementation history and design requirements are tracked in
[#292](https://github.com/mechubsec/mecmcp/issues/292). The dedup guard
question — the contract's `INSERT … WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT …)` cannot run
under the write identity, which SSDF grants INSERT-only on purpose — is
resolved: the sink reads a high-water mark under a separate, SELECT-only
identity instead (ssdf#47; see
[`sinks/ssdf.rs`](../crates/mecmcp-audit/src/sinks/ssdf.rs)).

The sink ships `ClosedSegment`s from the evidence recorder
([`recorder.rs`](../crates/mecmcp-audit/src/recorder.rs)) — the four
change-lifecycle record types. It does not carry the per-call tool audit
stream from Part 1: nothing feeds `audit.jsonl` into `SsdfSink` today, so
those records stay on the MCP host.

### Enabling it

Off by default and inert unless configured. Pass `--ssdf-audit-endpoint
<url>` — for example on rustjunosmcp — plus the paired credential and
identity flags (`EvidenceArgs` in
[`mecmcp-runtime/src/cli.rs`](../crates/mecmcp-runtime/src/cli.rs) has the
full set); a server started without `--ssdf-audit-endpoint` runs its evidence
pipeline as a no-op. The sink itself lives in
[`crates/mecmcp-audit/src/sinks/ssdf.rs`](../crates/mecmcp-audit/src/sinks/ssdf.rs).

### A second destination: the generic forward sink

SSDF stays the schema steward and the chain of record, but a deployment that
wants a copy of the same evidence trail somewhere else off-host — a SIEM, a
log collector, an object-lock bucket's HTTP front end — can enable
`ForwardSink` (MEC-459) alongside it: `--audit-forward-endpoint <url>` plus
`--audit-forward-outbox`/`--audit-forward-ledger` (`--audit-forward-token-file`
for a bearer token; see `EvidenceArgs` in
[`mecmcp-runtime/src/cli.rs`](../crates/mecmcp-runtime/src/cli.rs)). It
requires `--ssdf-audit-endpoint` to also be set — the forward sink rides on
the same recorder and chain identity — and is refused otherwise.

This is **not** the syslog path rejected below: it ships the same
hash-chained `ClosedSegment` SSDF ships, `prev_hash`/`head_hash` intact, as a
single JSON POST per segment rather than an unchained line in a table anyone
with write access can edit undetectably. It is additive and best-effort — a
forward-sink failure is logged and never affects SSDF's own delivery or
`EvidenceService::delivery_degraded`. See
[`crates/mecmcp-audit/src/sinks/forward.rs`](../crates/mecmcp-audit/src/sinks/forward.rs)
for the full reasoning and the local-ledger-only dedup caveat versus SSDF's
own high-water-mark guarantee.

### Why not syslog to the existing collector

A syslog path — `rsyslog` `imfile` tailing the JSON file, forwarding over TCP to
a new Vector source — was designed, staged and rejected. It is worth recording
why, because it is the obvious answer and it is cheaper:

**For it.** No code change in `mecmcp-audit`. Reuses the collector already
ingesting five device sources. `rsyslog`'s disk-assisted queue gives durability
for free — a collector restart or reboot buffers rather than discards.

**Against it, decisively.** The records are unchained. Anyone with write access
to the collector or the events table can edit history undetectably. Every other
link in this chain is tamper-evident by construction: plan digests bind
approvals, approvals name a distinct principal, `token_verified_fields`
separates vouched-for provenance from asserted. Shipping the trail over an
unchained final hop discards that guarantee at exactly the point an auditor
relies on it.

It also lands in `ssdf.events` — the device-telemetry table — rather than
`ssdf.audit`, where SSDF's own MCP servers already write their tool-call trail.
Two tables for one question is a reporting trap.

**What carries over.** If the direct sink ever needs a local spool, `rsyslog`'s
queue semantics are the reference: unlimited retry, disk-assisted, and
`saveOnShutdown` so a reboot does not discard the backlog. Durability was the one
thing the syslog design got right for free, and the direct sink has to build it
deliberately.

## Field mapping

Owned by the SSDF contract, not restated here. Two rules are called out because
getting them wrong produces a record that looks stronger than it is:

- **The observer is the MCP host**, never the managed device. The device is a
  target field. Conflating them collides with that device's own syslog stream,
  which arrives by a different path with different semantics.
- **`token_verified_fields` must survive into the record.** It names which
  provenance fields the *token* vouched for. Everything else in that group —
  `client_name`, `model_id`, `session_id` — is client-asserted and authenticated
  by nothing. An auditor who cannot tell them apart has been misled.

## Correlation

`request_id` is the join key. It appears on both audit records for a call — the
transport preflight event and the handler event — and, for Junos, in the device's
commit comment as `request.id=`. That is what links an MCP action to the change
it made on the device.

## Part 3 — At rest (normative)

Emission and transport are only worth as much as what the events sit in. Applied
to every deployed server 2026-08-20 (rustjunosmcp#299).

### Sealing

journald Forward Secure Sealing is enabled on every server, via a drop-in at
`/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/10-audit-sealing.conf`:

```ini
[Journal]
Storage=persistent
Seal=yes
```

plus `journalctl --setup-keys --interval=1month`. Sealing proves integrity only
from the moment the keys exist, so it is the first thing to enable and the one
item on this list that cannot be applied retroactively.

**`journalctl --setup-keys` fails on a minimal Debian 13 image** with
`Failed to generate key pair: Operation not supported`, even though
`systemctl --version` reports `+GCRYPT`. systemd 257 *dlopens* libgcrypt, and
the image does not ship it; the real error is one line above, in
`SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug` output — `libgcrypt.so.20 is not installed`.
`apt-get install libgcrypt20` is the whole fix. Nothing about the message points
there, so it is recorded here.

The verification key is printed once. It belongs **off** the machine: capture it
to a root-only file and move it, rather than letting it scroll past in a
terminal.

### Sinks

`--audit-journald` and `--audit-log-file` are additive, not alternatives. A
server that needs the standalone JSONL — `mecmcp-verify` and the bench read it
directly — runs **both**, so the same events get FSS coverage without taking the
file away. That is the resolution of the "per-guest sink question": no server has to
choose.

### Redaction

`--audit-redact <field>=hmac` with `--audit-hmac-key-file`, the key passed **by
path** so it can never appear in `ps` output or a unit file, mode 0600 and owned
by the service user. Pseudonymised values are stable
(`devices=hmac:63206a19…`), so correlation survives export while the inventory
does not leave the box.

Enabling it is a one-way door: events written before it are cleartext and will
not correlate with pseudonymised ones written after. Enable it on a server
before its trail matters, not after.

### Retention

Stated, not inherited, at
`/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/20-audit-retention.conf`:

```ini
[Journal]
SystemMaxUse=512M
SystemKeepFree=256M
MaxRetentionSec=90day
MaxFileSec=1day
```

Without these, journald sizes itself to 10% of the filesystem and discards
silently — how far back the trail reaches becomes a property of disk pressure
rather than a decision. The tighter of `MaxRetentionSec` and `SystemMaxUse`
wins, so raising one alone silently keeps less than it claims.

JSONL sinks get the equivalent through logrotate: `daily`, `rotate 14`,
`compress`, `copytruncate`, `create 0600 <service> <service>`. The mode matters
— an audit file every account on the box can read is not an audit trail.

## Known gaps

- **Central forwarding via `systemd-journal-upload`/rsyslog is deliberately
  not configured.** The destination this family wants is the hash-chained
  SSDF sink (shipped in 0.14.0, #292; see [Enabling it](#enabling-it)), and
  standing up a second, unchained forwarding path beside it is the thing
  [Why not syslog](#why-not-syslog-to-the-existing-collector) exists to avoid.
  A deployment that wants a second, off-host copy of the same chained
  records can enable
  [the generic forward sink](#a-second-destination-the-generic-forward-sink)
  (MEC-459) instead.
- **The per-call audit stream is not forwarded off-host.** Only
  change-lifecycle evidence (proposal, approval, apply intent, receipt)
  reaches `ssdf.audit`; Part 1's `audit.jsonl` — the per-call tool-call
  trail — stays on the MCP host with no chained off-host copy.
- **The device-side record omits the approver.** A two-person apply commits
  naming only the applier — see
  [rustjunosmcp#307](https://github.com/mechubsec/rustjunosmcp/issues/307).
- **Retention and journald sealing** are done — see Part 3
  ([rustjunosmcp#299](https://github.com/mechubsec/rustjunosmcp/issues/299)).
